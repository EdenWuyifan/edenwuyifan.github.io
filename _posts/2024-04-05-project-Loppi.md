## Introduction
I worked as the lead developer for Loppi, an iOS application dedicated to sublet searching and posting. Spearheaded the creation of several MVPs, encompassing features such as video playing, uploading, chatroom functionality, login pages, and bookmarking pages. Leveraged Swift, SwiftUI, and Firebase database for seamless integration and user experience enhancement.
