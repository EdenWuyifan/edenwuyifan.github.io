## 🎨 ARTITONE

**E-commerce Platform for Original Artworks & Interior Décor**  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repo-181717?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Artitone/ARTITONE)

### Overview

ARTITONE is an e-commerce marketplace specializing in original artworks and interior décor pieces crafted by emerging artists and designers. We offer a wide range of categories including paintings, photographs, sculptures, prints, wall decor, vases, rugs, curtains, and small furniture pieces.

### Solution & Technology

We leverage AI algorithms and zero-shot models on our server to extract keywords from artwork images uploaded by artists. This innovation:
- **Shortens the artwork registration process** significantly
- **Enhances search and recommendation capabilities** through color palette and texture analysis
- **Improves user experience** with intelligent content discovery

### Problem Statement

Individuals seeking affordable decoration options often struggle to find quality pieces, while emerging artists lack visibility and platforms to showcase and sell their work. ARTITONE bridges this gap by connecting non-luxury buyers with talented young artists.

### Target Customers

As an online marketplace, we serve two primary customer segments:
- **Emerging artists** seeking visibility and sales channels
- **Art and decoration enthusiasts** who need help making informed purchasing decisions
